# ML Version control

## Started at Udacity ML DEV/OPS nanodegree

Instance methods to be created to this lib:

1. read_csv
2. statistics
3. encode to binary categorical
4. histogram target, column
5. bar_plot df col normalized
6. dist_plot col
7. heatmap sns correlation matrix
8. define hypothesy matrix and target matrix
9. encode columns with groupby ... understand groupby
10. train_test_split
11. model tunning with GridSearch -> get params and model
12  plot_roc_curve ?
13. save best model with joblib
14. open and test model
15. shap.TreeExplainer(cv_rfc.best_estimator_)
16. feature importance with bar plot  
17. Report model tunning

# To-Do -> Finish ...
1. ~Unit-test until data_build_ml_matrix 95%~
  1.1. Unit-test until loading
2. Test inside project
3. TODO: Docstring and logging rest 
4. Unit-test until the end
5. Review algorithm process
6. TDD
7. Test-hml with solution
8. PEP and Pylint
9. Git clone repo with lib
